I'm a PhD student advised by <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/" target="_blank">Prof. Jignesh Patel</a> at the <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Sciences</a>, University of Wisconsin-Madison. The core theme of my research is to make database systems adaptive using techniques from (but not limited to) Machine Learning. Our goal is to promote adaptivity to different workload properties, the execution environment (the cloud for instance), and emerging hardware technologies such as <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/optane-dc-persistent-memory.html" target="_blank">non-volatile memory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive" target="_blank">solid state drives</a>.

Prior to pursuing graduate studies at UW Madison, I completed my bachelor's in computer sciences at <a href="https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Madras</a>, India where I worked with <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~jayalal/" target="_blank">Prof. Jayalal Sarma</a> as part of my undergraduate thesis. I originally hail from the town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guntur" target="_blank">Guntur</a>, India. In my free time, you can find me engaging in anything from cooking, solving jigsaw puzzles, watching anime, throwing on the wheel, and playing tennis.
