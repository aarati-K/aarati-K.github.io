I'm a PhD student advised by <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/" target="_blank">Prof. Jignesh Patel</a> at the <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Sciences</a>, University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research involves improving the resource efficiency of systems for data analysis by adapting fundamental data structures to the properties of the underlying hardware, the workload, and the execution environment.

<!-- My research uses novel techniques to make database systems adaptive to workload properties, the execution environment, and modern storage devices.  -->

<!-- My research uses techniques from (but not limited to) machine learning to make database systems adaptive to workload properties, the execution environment (the cloud for instance), and hardware technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive" target="_blank">solid state drives</a>. -->

Prior to pursuing graduate studies at UW Madison, I completed my bachelor's in computer sciences at <a href="https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Madras</a>, India where I worked with <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~jayalal/" target="_blank">Prof. Jayalal Sarma</a> as part of my undergraduate thesis. I originally hail from the town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guntur" target="_blank">Guntur</a>, India. In my free time, you can find me engaging in cooking, solving jigsaw puzzles, and playing tennis.
